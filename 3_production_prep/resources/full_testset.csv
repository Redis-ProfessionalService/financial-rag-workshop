The VAR model consisted of using a\nMonte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\nvalue, for a given confide nce interval, to the Company’ s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended\nto represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value  of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021.\nBecause the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by\nincreases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’ s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity\nanalyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,\nforeign currency exchange rates and the Company’ s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27']",$1.0 billion,simple,"[{'page_label': '30', 'file_name': 'aapl-10k-2023.pdf', 'file_path': '../resources/10k/aapl-10k-2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 840980, 'creation_date': '2024-06-03', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-03'}]",True

3,"What are potential risks for Apple if it doesn't meet regulatory expectations or faces antitrust scrutiny, given its ESG investments & reliance on 3rd party data?","['Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’ s business by\nincreasing the Compan y’s costs, limiting the Company’ s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the\nCompany’ s products and services, and requiring  changes to the Company’ s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also\ncreate uncer tainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’ s products and\nservices are introduced into specialized applicat ions, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed\nto ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’ s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such\nlaws and regulations or the Company’ s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely\naffect the Company’ s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect\nthe Company’ s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from\nsuch measu res. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has\nprograms, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures\nwill be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’ s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of\nwhich could materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs,\nreputational harm, and other adverse ef fects on the Company’ s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity , equity and inclusion. In\naddition, the Company makes statements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance\nreport, its other non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental,\nsocial and governance considerations and imple mentation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in\npart on third-party perfor mance or data that is outside the Company’ s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental,\nsocial and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’ s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived\nfailure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements,  comply with federal, state or international environmental, social\nand governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings\nagainst the Company and materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe techno logy indust ry, including, in some instances, the Company , is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny , which exposes\nthe Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The\nCompany may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions,\ncould require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages\ndistribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions aroun d the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims\nagainst the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’ s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such\ninvestigations result in adverse findings against the Company , the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its\nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also\nsubject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’ s business practices,', 'There can be no assurance the Company’ s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such\ninvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Compan y’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations\nor in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’ s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely\naffect the experience for users of the Company’ s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’ s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor\nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Company’ s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subjec t to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal\ninformation. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restric t transfers of personal information among the Company and its\ninternational subsidiaries . Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have\nlaws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisd iction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices.\nNoncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability .\nThe Compa ny makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy , information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedin gs against the Company by governmental entities or others. In\naddition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability .\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific\nobligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial\ndata are subject to addit ional privacy , security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding\nthe Company’ s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data\nis handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’ s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to\nlitigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised,\nthe Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry\ndata security  standards.  The Company could also experience a significant increase in paymen t card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment\ncards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Compa ny’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany’ s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’ s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressure s and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressu res; increased competition; the Company’ s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\ncontent for the Company’ s services; the Compan y’s ability to manage product quality and warran ty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or\nin the geographic, curre ncy or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or\nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’ s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company']","If Apple fails to meet regulatory expectations or faces antitrust scrutiny, it could face potential risks such as increased regulation, government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.

Reduced demand for Apple products: If consumers become more cautious about spending due to economic uncertainty, they may delay or cancel purchases of high-end electronics like iPhones. 2. Increased competition: As the economy slows down, competitors might gain an advantage by offering lower prices, which could make it harder for Apple to maintain its market share. 3. Supply chain disruptions: Economic headwinds can lead to supply chain issues, such as supplier insolvency or reduced capacity, making it difficult for Apple to deliver products on time and at the right quality. 4.
