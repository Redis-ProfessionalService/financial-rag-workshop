    "[Retrieval Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents) are useful when we want to make decisions about whether to retrieve from an index. Here we construct the same single index of 10Ks and earning calls along with some metadata we got from SEC that we tried in notebook 04 with ideas borrowed from notebook 05. The purpose of this notebook to demonstrate an agentic approach to RAG where a React agent powered by an LLM (a local llama3 LLM here) can react to the results of different tools in its disposal and/or employ different tools to find an answer to user's question. One the tools that the agent is using is a Redis retriever. This Redis retriever tool can run vector similarity search for a given question, and optionally apply filters to harness the full benefits of Redis Hybrid search that we showcased in notebook 04. The other objective of this notebook is to showcase an orchestrated effort (We use [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph) for this purpose) to infer the relevancy of users' question to our domain (finance here) and detection of pre-specified topics of the question; here we want to determine whether a question is more related to an earning call document or a 10K filing or it is out of our domain. We use the same the LLM here with different prompting and chain strategy, but you are not limited to one LLM. You can plug in your own fine-tuned or task-specific LLM here or even use other NLP/ML models that you trust (or certified) and explain for your purpose. \n",
