    "In notebook 5, we demonstrate an agentic approach to RAG where an agent powered by an LLM can react to the results of different tools in its disposal and/or employ different tools to find an answer to user's question. In this example, we extend the functionality to determine if a user's question is more related to an earning call document or a 10k filing or if it's out of the financial domain entirely. Moreover, we showcase how different language models can easily be integrated.\n",
