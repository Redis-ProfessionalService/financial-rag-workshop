    "In this notebook, we will utilize agents to improve upon the simple RAG application showcased in the last example (04). The key distinction with Agents is they utilize a language model to determine which steps to perform next as opposed to chains which execute the same flow regardless of input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we will implement a [Retrieval Agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents) and incorporate it into a [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph).\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a Redis retrieval agent, we simply need to give an LLM access to a Redis retriever tool. By doing this the agent layer will only invoke the retriever when necessary preventing unnecessary, unrelated, and/or unwanted interactions with our financial chat tool."
