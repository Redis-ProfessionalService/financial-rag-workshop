   "source": "As we saw in notebook 06, a React agentic approach to search and treating a Redis retriever as a tool, and moreover leaving the reasoning to an LLM could lead to some uncertainty. A react agentic approach might be a better approach for planning in an uncertain situation (maybe a robotic application where parameters of the problem are unknown) and not for a search application where the tasks and steps to take are very well-defined. Any search starts with a query by a user. The first task is to understand the query or user's question. The hardest part is to understand the intent of the user which might need some personalized and contextual understanding of the user - which we will not address here. Nevertheless, the first component of a search application is query understanding. The second component is constructing a refined query via query augmentation, translation of user's query into a combination of target query language and mapping the query into a vector space using an embedding model. After query translation and representation in a vector space, it is time to retrieve the relevant documents. Here we showcase the Redis hybrid search capabilities and its integration in langchain. After fetching the most relevant documents, usually reranking happens (and by reranking we don't necessarily mean Semantic reranking - one could apply business logic in this step; for example, Ad injection and/or reordering based on business and user's context such as location or session information). In this notebook we don't use a reranker but employ a very simple document relevancy checker using the same `llama3` LLM. However, in a more realistic scenario, one should use task-specific or fine-tuned LLMs for each of these steps or even use the existing models or pipelines (query classifier, Learning To Rank, etc.). In fact, it might be a requirement that some models need to run faster/cheaper or be more explainable or certified for complaince reasons (such as Logistic Regression, decision trees, MaxEnt etc.) Please plug in any of such models instead of our generic LLM-based component if needed.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The problem of search is still an old problem, and it is about representation of your information and storing it and getting back what you search for via a retrieval method. In the new `RAG` paradigm, information representation is the vector representation. So the more you can capture the nuances of your data using better and better embedding models, the better the `Retrieval`. However, as demonstrated above, we still need to take advantage of our metadata to increase the accuracy and `Augment` the query and also augment the context that we present to the `Generation` component. And most recently, LLMs do a good job of generating proper answers in the target natural languages. The quality of LLMs and their awareness of the domain language increase the quality of generated response.   "
